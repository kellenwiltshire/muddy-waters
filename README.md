# Muddy Waters Restaurant

Mock website for a local Restaurant




## Lessons Learned

I used this project as a way to learn and become more familiar with Bootstrap. While I prefer TailwindCSS, Bootstrap is a very popular tool and it was great to try it out and become more familiar. I also put this site on Netlify as I had never used their service before.

I picked this restaurant to use as a learning experience because they don't have an online presence outside of Facebook. They also only have their menu online by posting photo's taken of the menu. Once I was done I sent them this site and offered it to them but unfortunately never heard back.
